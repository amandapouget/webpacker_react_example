The first commit is what you get with rails new my_app.

The second commit shows the difference. This is what you get if you install webpacker:react following the rails documentation. Use the diff to discern what will happen if you add it to an existing application.

The third commit makes the example that comes with installing webpack actually appear on the screen.

The fourth commit shows how to use the webpacker-react gem and node package to make it possible to pass props from a view to a React component.
